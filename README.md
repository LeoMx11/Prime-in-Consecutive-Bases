# Prime-in-Consecutive-Bases
An interactive program in which the user inputs a maximum number of iterations, and the algorithm finds the maximum consecutive bases for which the string is prime in base 10 (Ex: the string "10" is prime in both base 2 and base 3 (making 2 and 3 respectively), so the algorithm would return 3.
